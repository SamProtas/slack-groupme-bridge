# slack-groupme-bridge

A messaging bridge connecting a GroupMe Group with a Slack Channel.

As part of an attempt to migrate my friends' group message from GroupMe to Slack I'm building this. The hope is this
will make it possible for a portion of the group to migrate to Slack without fragmenting the conversation. Then we can
peer pressure the hold outs üòè.
